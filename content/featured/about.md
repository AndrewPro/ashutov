Hey there! Thanks for going to the about page! Let me tell you a little about myself. 

Here is a photo of me and Ilya in Shanghai. I am I shorter person.

As I have mentioned before, I love technology. I have been introduced to the world of tech from a young age and I have always wanted to pursue it.

I have always been fascinated in understanding how a technology worked and have always had the feeling of satisfaction whenever working with tech.

I simply love tech! Check out my [homeLab](/homelab/homeLab.md) if you have the chance.

I also have a deep love for nature! Whether it’s going on hikes with my family or embarking on crazy adventures with the boys, nature is always a place I feel at home. I enjoy boating, crabbing, fishing, offroading with ATVs and camping. I’ve been fortunate to have so many amazing opportunities, and I’m incredibly grateful for each of them. 

One more fact about me; I play the saxophone in my church orchestra. I absolutely love playing the saxophone, and I deeply value my church community. My relationship with God is very important to me, and I strive to seek Him in my daily life. In the future, I hope to integrate videos into this site so I can share some of the songs I play.

If you are checking out the video, I recommend you take a look at the last song we played. It is a great closing song.

<!-- Q: Is there a short code for hugo where I can make a slide show of images? So that I can share more than one.  -->
